Camera Chat Mod
==================
This mod allows you to type coordinates in chat and the game will send you there! Very useful if someone wants you to look somewhere by coordinates.

Usage
=====
Simply write `c 276:217` into the chat box to send your game to the coordinates 276:217. Note, the `c ` MUST have a space after it, and the coordinates must also have a colon between them.

That's it!

Required Mods
=============
The [RC Mod API](https://github.com/grnt426/RC-Mod-API) is the only required mod.

Install
=====
Dump this file into the `Rising Constellation/dist/main/` directory of wherever your game is installed.

Known Issues
===========
If the coordinates you provide are outside the bounds of the galaxy, such as too small numbers or very large numbers, your screen will turn all black and the client will be useless. I will try to find a way to prevent invalid coordinates from being accepted.
